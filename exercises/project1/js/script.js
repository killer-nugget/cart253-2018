Game - Chaser
Pippin Barr

A simple game of cat and mouse.

Physics-based movement, keyboard controls, health/stamina,
sprinting, random movement, screen wrap.


1.DONE Modify the way the prey moves to use Perlin noise and the noise() function instead of the random() function it uses now.
(You'll need to get rid of the conditional that chooses when the prey changes direction, it should only use noise()).

2.Add the ability to "sprint" for the player when they hold down the shift key (using keyDown() in the handleInput() function for this is probably a good idea).
Make them lose health faster when they are sprinting. Don't forget to reset to the player's normal speed when they stop sprinting.

3.Add variables and conditionals as needed to make the game more interesting to play by varying the player and prey's size, speed, visibility,
and/or anything else you can think of during play (maybe the prey get harder to see as the player gets more successful, maybe the player gets bigger the more it eats, etc.)
 - try to have a reason why each thing happens.

4.Tune the values of the game's variables to make the gameplay more interesting to play (is the prey too slow? Should it move more erratically?
Should the player be faster? Slower? Etc.)

5.Change the visuals of the game and add sounds so that the game is no longer abstract but conveys an idea through both its gameplay and through its aesthetics
(maybe it could be about politics, or relationships, or cooking, or playing chess, or anything else!).
The new visuals and sounds should match the gameplay you created in step two

  *Make sure you use functions to better organise your code!
  *Don't limit yourself to the above five challenges, if you've got the time, make the game even better!
